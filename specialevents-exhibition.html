            <p>Get your family together for an exciting night in 
                the museum as you sleep over beside dinosaurs and science displays.

            <h2>Energetica Exhibition on Loan</h2>
            <p>On loan from the NEMO Science Museum in Amsterdam, 
                the Energetica exhibition is coming to the Community Science Museum. 
                It’s a series of installations that allow visitors to experience the power 
                of the elements as we harness them. 
                From solar energy powering lighting, 
                to ‘Wind Island’ that shows how turbines are able to use and control wind to create power.
